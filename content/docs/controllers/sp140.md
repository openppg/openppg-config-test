## Intro

OpenPPG SP140 Controller uses WebUSB to communicate from your browser to your device.

Make sure you are using one of the [supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/webusb).
We recomend Chrome.

## Get started

1. Plug the microUSB cable into your controller and connect to your PC or phone.
2. You may see a notification pop up from your browser. Now navigate to the [config tool](/configurators/sp140/).

## Using the SP140 Config Tool

### Units

Prefer to view your altitude in meters or feet? Simply toggle this to update the controller setting.

### Performance Mode

These change the dynamics of the SP140 throttle and serve different flying styles.
Chill is less responsive and reduces max power to 75%. Sport unlocks full power and is more sensitive.

We recommend flying in chill mode until you get comfortable with the instant power the OpenPPG SP140 can provide.

### Updating firmware

Firmware updates are simple.

1. Download the .uf2 firmware you wish to flash
2. With the controller connected press "reboot in update mode" to switch to the uf2 compatible bootloader. The screen will flash then turn off.
3. Drag or paste the .uf2 file onto the newly added USB drive and wait for a reboot.
